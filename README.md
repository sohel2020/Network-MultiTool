# Network-Multitool
A (**multi-arch**) multitool for container/network testing and troubleshooting, based on Alpine Linux. The container image contains lots of tools, as well as nginx web server, which listens on port 80 and 443 by default. The web server helps to run this container-image in a straight-forward way, so you can simply `exec` into the container and use various tools.

Supported platforms: linux/386,linux/amd64,linux/arm/v7,linux/arm64,linux/ppc64le,linux/s390x

## Downloadable from Docker Hub: 
* [https://hub.docker.com/r/praqma/network-multitool/](https://hub.docker.com/r/praqma/network-multitool/)  (Automated multi-arch Build)

# Tools included:
* apk package manager
* Nginx Web Server (port 80, port 443) - customizable ports!
* wget, curl, iperf3
* dig, nslookup
* ip, ifconfig, ethtool, mii-tool, route
* ping, nmap, arp, arping
* awk, sed, grep, cut, diff, wc, find, vi editor
* ps, netstat, ss
* gzip, cpio
* tcpdump, wireshark, tshark
* telnet client, ssh client, ftp client, rsync, scp
* traceroute, tracepath, mtr
* netcat (nc), socat
* ApacheBench (ab)
* mysql & postgresql client
* jq
* git
* kubectl
* helm
* awscli

**Note:** The SSL certificates are generated for 'localhost', are self signed, and placed in `/certs/` directory. During your testing, ignore the certificate warning/error. While using curl, you can use `-k` to ignore SSL certificate warnings/errors.

# Configurable HTTP and HTTPS ports:
There are times when one may want to join this (multitool) container to another container's IP namespace for troubleshooting. This is true for both Docker and Kubernetes platforms. During that time if the container in question is a web server (nginx), then network-multitool cannot join it in the same IP namespace on Docker, and similarly it cannot join the same pod on Kubernetes. This is because network multitool also runs a web server on port 80 (and 443), and this results in port conflict on the same IP address. To help in this sort of troubleshooting, there are two envronment variables **HTTP_PORT** and **HTTPS_PORT** , which you can use to provide the values of your choice instead of 80 and 443. When the container starts, it uses the values provided by you/user to listen for incoming connections. Below is an example:

```
[kamran@kworkhorse network-multitool]$ docker run -e HTTP_PORT=1180 -e HTTPS_PORT=1443 -p 1180:1180 -p 1443:1443 -d local/network-multitool

[kamran@kworkhorse network-multitool]$ docker ps

[kamran@kworkhorse network-multitool]$ curl localhost:1180
Praqma Network MultiTool (with NGINX) - 4636efd4660c - 172.17.0.3/16

[kamran@kworkhorse network-multitool]$ curl -k https://localhost:1443
Praqma Network MultiTool (with NGINX) - 4636efd4660c - 172.17.0.3/16
[kamran@kworkhorse network-multitool]$ 
```  

If these environment variables are absent/not provided, the container will listen on normal/default ports 80 and 443.

# FAQs
## Why this multitool runs a web-server?
Well, normally, if a container does not run a daemon/service, then running it (the container) involves using creative ways / hacks to keep it alive. If you don't want to suddenly start browsing the internet for "those creative ways", then it is best to run a small web server in the container - as the default process. 

This helps when you are using kubernetes. You simply execute:
```
$ kubectl run multitool --image=praqma/network-multitool --replicas=1
```

This also helps you when you are using Docker. You simply execute:
```
$ docker run  -d praqma/network-multitool
```

The multitool container starts as web server. Then, you simply connect to it using:
```
$ kubectl exec -it multitool-3822887632-pwlr1  bash
```
Or, on Docker:
```
$ docker exec -it some-silly-container-name bash 
```

This is why it is good to have a web-server in this tool. Hope this answers the question! Besides, I believe that having a web server in a multitool is like having yet another tool! Personally, I think this is cool! [Henrik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrikrenehoegh/) thinks the same!

## I can't find a tool I need for my use-case?
We have tried to put in all the most commonly used tools, while keeping it small and practical. We can't have all the tools under the sun in it, otherwise it will end up as [something like this](https://www.amazon.ca/Wenger-16999-Swiss-Knife-Giant/dp/B001DZTJRQ).  

However, if you have a special need, for a special tool, for your special use-case, then I would recommend to simply build your own docker image using this one as base image, and expanding it with the tools you need.

## Why not use LetsEncrypt for SSL certificates instead of generating your own?
There is absolutely no need to use LetsEncrypt. This is a testing tool, and validity of SSL certificates does not matter.
